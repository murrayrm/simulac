RMM, 10 May 2010: minor enhancements
  * Added -o option for saving simulation output
  * Added --python-setup to generate python compatabile file
  * Added -C, --config-file to use configuration file parsing
  * New options for system-file, maximum-time and print-time

RMM, 4 May 2010: memory cleanup
  * Trying to fix crashes in LambdaQs-Qrep runs 
  * Rewrote stochiometry matrix allocations to fix valgrind errors
  * Small change in segment dynamics to avoid accessing pointer after free
  * Updated Memory.c to set pointers in blocks to NULL after they are handed out
  * Reset various points to NULL to make sure we don't free things twice

RMM, 4 May 2010: implemented DebugLevel
  * DebugLevel = 0: no output
  * DebugLevel = 1: minimal about (showing sim is running)
  * DebugLevel = 2: show limited information about parsing
  * DebugLevel = 3: give details about parsing

RMM, 19 Apr 10: added code for ribosome binding strength
  * RibosomeBindingRate can now be set for individual GENE
  * Use RibosomeBindingRate at end of ProtData file

RMM, 5 Apr 10: Added code for non-anti-terminated terminators
  * Checks to see if first entry is TermModifier or not
  * *Should* work with existing reaction dynamics
	
RMM, 5 Apr 10: Allow proper spelling of promoter
  * Updated ParseDatabase to allow "Promotor" or "Promoter"

RMM, 15 Mar 10: fixed up autoconf configuration
  * Set up proper files for distribution, include examples
  * Updated scripts and README files

RMM, 14 Mar 10: reorganized lambda example
  * Moved configuration files to config/ subdir
  * Added sample MATLAB scripts for running simulations and printing data
  * Added a README file with information on how to run things

RMM, 14 Mar 10: added MATLAB setup file output
 * Use --matlab-setup to generate .m file with parameters, indices
 * Got rid of --long-headers, since this essentially covers that
	
RMM, 14 Mar 10: added config files for using GNU autoconf

RMM, 23 Jan 10: minor updates
  * added -p, --pops option to turn on PoPs output
  * fixed Makefile dependencies for cmdline.[ch]
  * created Pending file and moved Changes to trunk
  * updated OpenFile to check for SIMULAC_CONFDIR and search there for files

RMM, 19 Nov 09: added code to track transcript initiation
  * Added new list of promoters + extra data elements
  * Count the number of open complexes on each promoter and output

RMM, 15 Nov 09: updates to cell division
  * Added -s, --single to turn off cell growth ("single cell")
  * Cell size normalization now down by reference size (versus initial)

RMM, 15 Nov 09: added flag to set MOI on command line
  * Use -m, --moi to set MOI for all segments
  * This needs to be generalized later

RMM, 3 Oct 09: added command line parameters
  * Can set cell volume, growth rate, initial concentrations, rate constants
    from command line
  * See simulac.ggo for a list of options
