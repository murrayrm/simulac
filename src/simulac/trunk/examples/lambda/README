README file for MATLAB scripts
RMM, 11 March 2010

This directory contains some MATLAB scripts that can be used to
perform batch runs of simulac and read the results back into MATLAB in
a form useful for printing.  The following scripts are available in
the main directory:

* gensims_moi.m - run simulations at different MOI values
* gensims_vol.m - run simulations with different cell volumes
* arkin_fig3.m - generate plots similar to Arkin et al, Fig 3
* fstp_fig3.m - generate plots similar to St. Pierre and Endy, Fig 3
